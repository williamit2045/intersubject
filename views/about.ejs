  <h1>Intersubject</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">A new infrastructure for collective intelligence and shared identity.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Intersubject reveals the minds that emerge between us."
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Why It Exists</h2>
  <p>We live in a fragmented world‚Äîour truths buried under performance, our shared ground erased by algorithms. Intersubject restores coherence not by promoting sameness, but by letting differences overlap and speak.</p>
  <p>What begins as simple identification‚Äî<em>"I relate to this"</em>‚Äîbecomes a structural act: identity rendered not as profile, but as <strong>resonant pattern</strong>.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <h3>ü™û Identify</h3>
  <p>You relate to a sentence. You click "Identify." That cohort now includes you. No algorithm. No profile. Just recognition.</p>

  <h3>üß† Overlap</h3>
  <p>As people identify with multiple expressions, the system reveals which expressions share members‚Äîmaking relationships visible across ideas.</p>

  <h3>üï∏Ô∏è Map</h3>
  <p>These overlaps generate emergent networks‚Äîwhat some might call collective minds. You can explore them, trace them, or help shape them.</p>

  <h2>What Makes It Different</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Branding:</strong> Expressions are collective. No usernames next to ideas. No ego performance. Just shared resonance.</li>
    <li><strong>No Categorization:</strong> No tags or forced taxonomies. Patterns form naturally through shared participation.</li>
    <li><strong>No Feed:</strong> There‚Äôs nothing to scroll. You‚Äôre not here to perform. You‚Äôre here to reflect, to explore, to cohere.</li>
    <li><strong>Visible Intelligence:</strong> As overlaps accumulate, the map reflects identities that were never visible before‚Äîplural, real, alive.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Grounded in Theory</h2>
  <p>Intersubject is conceptually aligned with the <a href="https://www.unifiedtheoryofknowledge.org" target="_blank">Tree of Knowledge (ToK) System</a>‚Äîa framework for integrating biological and cultural evolution. Like ToK, this platform views self and mind not as isolated containers, but as emergent patterns across space and time.</p>
  <p>Intersubject provides what no other system yet has: the infrastructure for <em>visible, emergent coherence</em>. Not prediction. Not persuasion. Mutual representation without performance.</p>

  <h2>Join the Experiment</h2>
  <p>Every time you identify with an expression, you add clarity to the map. Every overlap helps culture see itself more clearly. This platform only works because of you.</p>
